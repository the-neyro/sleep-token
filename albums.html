Will you listen just as my form starts to fission?
Losing this war of attrition just as I drift away

Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?

With the shadows longer to me than a light-year
Moving so slow, I could die here
Say you can hear me say

Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?

Now I know why I woke up here on the shoreline
Coughing up blood in the twilight
Everything looks the same

Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?

I've got eyelids heavy enough to break diamonds
You pray for sound and I pray for silence
Damn right faithless, I can't deny
You'll find me with half a mind to get violent

Oh, it isn't over 'til I say it's over
And oh, my little angel sitting on my shoulder
So give me the edge of a blade and a time and a place
And I'll leave them cold and pushing up boulders

Am I walking with gods or merely stumbling forth?
Until there's fire at the gates, until I fall to the floor
You know I live by the feather and die by the sword
And I will sunder the earth, only to burn the rewards

Even in this garden of gardens, I am the god of the gaps
I am the demon of Sodom, I am the blood of an angel
The fate of the fallen, nobody knows where I came from
Even I have forgotten

How can I already lose my way like this?
Drowning in burning bright abyss
Even at stratospheric depths
This vertigo of bliss

Oh, and I
I used to know myself
Oh, and you
You used to know me well
Oh, and I
I wish that I could leave myself alone
Oh, and you
You wish that you could make me whole

Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?

Well, you were laid in verse, living on a promised word
Well, I am the rose you relinquished again
You and I are down headfirst in another world, I heard
I have a feeling we're close to the end

So come on, come on
Out from underneath who you were
Come on, come on now
You know that it's time to emerge

So go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah
Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah

Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah
Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah 

Are you carbide on my nano, red glass on my lightbulb
Dark light on my culture, sapphire on my white gold?
Burst out of my chest and hide out in the vents
My blood beats so alive, might bite right through your lens 

It's midnight in my mind's eye, drowning out the daylight
Godspeed to my enemies who've been asking for that call sign
You know the behaviour, canines of the saviour
Glory to the legion, trauma for the neighbours

So go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah
Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah

Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me, yeah
Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me (huh, whoo)

I've got solar flares for your dead gods, space dust for your fuel rods
Dark days for your solstice, dancing through the depths of
Hellfire, on the winds that started from within
My blood beats so alive, might tear right through my skin 

So tell me what you meant by "living past your half-life"
In lockstep with the universe, and you're well-versed in the afterlife
You know that I'm sanctified by what's below
No matter what you do, no matter where you go

You might be the one to take away the pain and let my mind go quiet
And nothing else is quite the same as how I feel when I'm at your side

Come on, come on
Out from underneath who you were
Come on, come on now
You know that it's time to emerge

Go ahead and wrap your arms around me
Arms around me, arms around me (huh, whoo)

And you might be the one to take away the pain and let my mind go quiet
And nothing else is quite the same as how I feel when I'm at your side

Well, are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now
Are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now, now, now

Clawed out of my woodwork
Bolts out of my blue depths
In and out of my dreamscapes
People acting different
One look at my past self
Double take on my cash flow
Apologizing for shit that frankly
I stopped thinking of years ago

And you know I deliberate on cutting out the demons
I still need a dark side, they just need a reason
The passage of the hours into rushing through the seasons
Falling through my mind with the leaves on the trees, so

Keep me alive, keep me believing
That now is the time to take it or leave it
Gave away all my blessings
Lift off, weightless
Torn apart by the true believers that turned out to be faithless

Are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now
Are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now, now, now

Are you the guardian angel hacking into my brain cells?
Stepping up from my future, uploading my true self
Did I get this far for nothing, or are you the reward?
Guarding hounds in this hell house, opening new doors

If this is love, then I am out of hesitation
Head over heels or elevation
Walking an inch above the pavement
Taking it stride by stride together
If this is real, then I am all up in a frenzy
Not like before when I was empty
Say that the story we tell is never-ending
Taking it side by side together (side by side together)

Are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now
Are you gonna dance on the line with me?
You know it's not a game or a fantasy
And I don't even know who I used to be
But nothing is the same and some things have to change now, now, now

Lost again

I just don't want to be lost again

I wish I could have known that
Look in your eyes would echo in mine and go back
Out of my mind, across the line
When was the last time I felt like this?
Dark desire and tainted bliss

It's like you're dangerous to me
I notice every time we meet
I feel the ground beneath my feet
Giving way
You've got me talking in my sleep
As if you're conquering my dreams
You have awakened what's beneath
Again

Well, I thought I could resist you
But something in me just can't help but insist
To blur the lines just one last time so
When's the last time you tasted blood?
And what will it take to stem the flood?

And I am caught in time
Like clockwork beneath the permafrost
I might lose my mind
Back to back with oblivion
And you might breathe that burning breeze through
Paradise for me

It's like you're dangerous to me
I notice every time we meet
I feel the ground beneath my feet
Giving way
You've got me talking in my sleep
As if you're conquering my dreams
You have awakened what's beneath
Again

Count me out like sovereigns, payback for the good times
Right foot in the roses, left foot on a landmine
I'm not gonna be there tripping on the grapevine
They can sing the words while I cry into the bassline

Wear me out like Prada, devil in my detail
I swear it's getting harder even just to exhale
Backed up into corners, bitter in the lens
I'm sick of trying to hide it every time they take mine

So stick to me
Stick to me like caramel
Walk beside me 'til you feel nothin' as well

They ask me, "Is it goin' good in the garden?"
Say, "I'm lost, but I beg no pardon"
Up on the dice, but low on the cards, I try not to talk about how it's harder now
Can I get a mirror side-stage? Looking sideways at my own visage, gettin' worse
Every time they try to shout my real name just to get a rise from me
Acting like I'm never stressed out by the hearsay
I guess that's what I get for trying to hide in the limelight
Guess that's what I get for having 20-20 hindsight
Everybody wants eyes on 'em, I just wanna hear you sing that top line

And if you don't think I mean it, then I understand
But I'm still glad you came, so let me see those hands

So stick to me
Stick to me like caramel
Walk beside me 'til you feel nothin' as well
I'm fallin' free of the final parallel
The sweetest dreams are bitter
But there's no one left to tell

Too young to get bitter over it all
Too old to retaliate like before
Too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know
So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm
This stage is a prison, a beautiful nightmare (too young to get bitter over it all)
A war of attrition, I'll take what I'm given (too old to retaliate like before)
The deepest incisions, I thought I got better (too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know)
But maybe I didn't

tell me, did I give you what you came for?
(I wish it all away) terrified to answer my own front door
(I thought things had changed) missin' my wings in a realm of angels
(But everything's the same)

So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm
This stage is a prison, a beautiful nightmare
A war of attrition, I'll take what I'm given
The deepest incisions, I thought I got better
But maybe I didn't

Come now, swing wide those gates
'Cause I have paid my penance kindly well in time for judgment day
Somehow I knew my fate
Turns out the gods we thought were dying were just sharpening their blades

Have you been waiting long
For me?

I am the final dawn, I am the flood
And what was missing from those scriptures will be written in my blood
Dig down into the mud
What good is all this talk of wings when there is nothing left above?

Have you been waiting long
For me?
Have you been waiting long?

No matter how we feel
We've got a taste for one another and a few good years to kill
No matter what is real
It seems that even in Arcadia you walk beside me still

Crawled up on you, do I wanna go there? Yes, I do
I wanna do more than just bend the rules
But you been hittin' my phone so hard
I found it breathin' through a tube in the ICU
Yeah, I see you, the only bad baddy spinning eyes in the room
The only good girl in this side of the moon
You're the only game that I like to lose

When you look at me like that, got me fallin' right back
Oh, when you look at me like that, got me fallin' right back

And your fingers foxtrot on my skin
I'm going under this time
I can give you what you want

And our bodies converse like old friends
Exchangin' the years in silence
With something unsaid on both ends
Surely we know the difference

I wanna be your provider
Garner you in silk like a spider
Roll a die, you bet, I'm a rider

Well, I've been waking up under blades, blue blossom days
If only Damocles would hit me back
No alabaster carvings or faces on a farthing
Would prevent my head from fading to black

And it feels like falling into the sea
From outer space in seconds to me
And I play discordant days on repeat
Until they look like harmony

When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
Come up for air and choke on it all
No one else knows that I've got a problem
What if I can't get up and stand tall?
What if the diamond days are all gone, and
Who will I be when the empire falls?
Wake up alone, and I'll be forgotten

Well, I know I should be touring, I know these chords are boring
But I can't always be killing the game
No golden grand pianos or voices from the shadows
Will do anything but feel the same

And it feels like falling into the deep
From somewhere way up over the peaks
And I play discordant days on repeat
Until the tape runs out on me

When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
Come up for air and choke on it all
No one else knows that I've got a problem
What if I can't get up and stand tall?
What if the diamond days are all gone, and
Who will I be when the empire falls?
Wake up alone, and I'll be forgotten

And nobody told me I'd be begging for relief
When what is silent to you feels like it's screaming to me
Well, nobody told me I'd get tired of myself
When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell

When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
Come up for air and choke on it all
No one else knows that I've got a problem
What if I can't get up and stand tall?
What if the diamond days are all gone, and
Who will I be when the empire falls?
Wake up alone, and I'll be forgotten

I wanted you to know, I've learned to live without it
And even though it's colder now, I no longer feel surrounded
And you never listened to me, and that's the thing I tell the others
You were my harlequin bride, I was your undercover lover, but no
You never saw me naked, you wouldn't even touch me
Except if you were wasted
But you were trying your best, and that's the thing I tell the others
I was your robot companion, you were my favourite colour, and, oh

And I'm caught up on the person I tried to turn myself into for you
Someone who didn't mind the push-pull parlour games
Someone who wasn't always cryin' on the journey back
Someone who didn't feel the low blows either way
Thought I was waitin' for you, when all along
It was you with the countdown kill switch
And it was me with the blindfold on

And I was tryin' my best, and that's the thing I tell the mirror
I was in love with the thought that we were in love with each other

What might be good for your heart
Might not be good for my head
And what was there at the start
Might not be there in the end

Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better
Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better

Came in like a dream, put it down like a smoke

Your cigarette ash still clinging to my clothes
I don't wanna stick around

No one's gonna save me from my memories
Nothing to lose, but I would've given anythin'
To get closer to you and all your enemies
I've got a few of my own
And this throne didn't come with a gun, so I got a different energy
I still see you when the lights get low
I still hear you when I'm on my own
The parasites and the nightmares calling my name like, "Please just let me go"

This one's for you and your problems, your good day job
Your bad karma, what are you afraid of?
The same trauma, show me what you're made of
'Cause you talk about your constant pain like I ain't got none
And I've learned to live beside it, and even though it's over now
I will always be reminded

When you plucked me from the grotto
Silent like a supermodel
When I would wake in staccato
No lightning in a bottle, just
One eye on the target
And two bricks on the throttle
I know now

That even if I am frozen
Timeless as a ghost in my
Nightmares of the ocean
The precipice I'm approaching
Well, you will empty the darkness
You will keep me in motion
I know now

Infinite baths
Washing over me at last
Are you the method in my madness?
Are you the glory in my wrath?
Infinite baths
Bursting colours when you laugh
Well, I have fought so long to be here
I am never going back

Even if I'm on my own
When the silence is deafening
I could be stuck here alone
When even my future is threatening
Something is lifting the bones
Something is dancing in revelry
Wider than oceans below
Taller than titans on box springs

And the waters are warm
Where they used to run freezing
Where there used to be storms
My horizon is fleeting
I'm so tired inside
I could sleep through a landslide
But I'm finally here
And I'm not leaving this time

Infinite baths
Washing over me at last
Are you the method in my madness?
Are you the glory in my wrath?
Infinite baths
Bursting colours when you laugh
I've been running since I got here
But now I'm falling into
Infinite baths

Drift with me
Drift with me
Drift with me
Drift with me

All this glory you did not earn
Every lesson you did not learn
You will drown in an endless sea
If it's blood that you want from me
You can empty my arteries
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
In me?

Teeth of God
Blood of man
I will be
What I am

When we were made
It was no accident
We were tangled up like branches in a flood
I come as a blade
A sacred guardian
So you keep me sharp and test my worth in blood

You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a-

Beneath the stormy seas
Above the mountain peaks
It's all the same to me
It makes no difference
I've seen my days unfold
Done the impossible
I'd turn my walls to gold
To bring you home again

So show me that which I cannot see
Even if it hurts me
Even if I can't sleep
Oh, and though we act out of our holy duty to be constantly awake

You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold

Even if it hurts me
Even if I can't sleep
Show me the way

I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
A taste of the divine

You've got my body, flesh, and bone, yeah
The sky above, the earth below

Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side

See the other side

You've got my body, flesh, and bone
The sky above, the earth below

Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side

Won't you show me what it's like?
Won't you show me what it's like?

Oh, and my love
Did I mistake you for a sign from God?
Or are you really here to cast me off?
Or maybe just to turn me on
'Cause these days
I would be lying if I told you that
I didn't wish that I could be your man
Or maybe make a good girl bad

I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do

Nothing to say and nowhere to go

Sulfur on your breath
Granite in my chest
You won't ever have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it
Fury too damn late
Reason dislocates
And you'll never have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it

I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the secondhand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want me, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am

When you sit there acting like you know me
Acting like you only brought me here to get below me
Never mind the death threats, parting at the door
We'd rather be six feet under than be lonely
And if you had a problem, then you should've told me
Before you started getting all aggressive and controlling
You only drink the water when you think it's holy
So keep an eye on the road, or we will both be here forever

I was more than just a body in your passenger seat

Well, my love is an animal call
Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls
Between teeth on a broken jaw
Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw
These days I'm a circuit board
Integrated hardware you cannot afford
The perfect start to a perfect war
Putting down the roses, picking up the sword

Aqua regia
Aqua regia

Well, my past is a holy book
A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook
Between the pain and the way you look
I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook
And these days I'm a picture frame
Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain
Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain
All of Eden's vices running through my veins

Aqua regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of

Oh, and I am done dancing to alarm bells
No wonder my ears are still ringing
And I am done fighting off change
No wonder my arms are still swinging

Aqua regia

You have become the voice in my head
Only recourse we're left after death
Your viscera welcome me in
Welcome me in

My life is torn, my bones, they bleed
My metaphors fall short in the end
Your flesh and bone welcome me in
Welcome me in

Are you in pain like I am?

Will we remain stuck in the throat of gods?
Will the pain stop if we go deeper?

So let's get swallowed whole
I wanna go where nobody else will
Ever go

Walls of flesh, so warm again
We step into my suffering
My only need, welcome me in
Welcome me in

There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once
Follow me between the jaws of fate
So I can have you to myself for once

So let's get swallowed whole
I wanna go where nobody else will
Ever go

There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once

Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?

Well, I know what you want from me
You want someone to be
Your reflection, your bitter deception
Setting you free
So you take what you want, then leave

Who made you like this?
Who encrypted your dark gospel in body language?
Synapses snap back in blissful anguish
Tell me you met me in past lives, past lie
Past what might be eating me from the inside, darling
Half algorithm, half deity
Glitches in the code or gaps in a strange dream
Tell me you guessed my future and it mapped onto your fantasy
Turn me into your mannequin and I'll turn you into my puppet queen

Won't you come and dance in the dark with me?
Show me what you are, I am desperate to know
Nobody better than the perfect enemy
Digital demons make the night feel heavenly

Make it real
'Cause anything's better than the way I feel right now
I can offer you a blacklit paradise
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

Lipstick, chemtrails, red flags, pink nails
With one eye on the door, other eye on a rail
While the other eye following a scarlet trail
And the last few drops from the Holy Grail, now
Rose gold chains, ripped lace, cut glass
Blood stains on the collar means just don't ask
Be the first to the feast
Let's choke on the past
And take to the broken skies at last

You make me wish I could disappear
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

You're gonna watch me ascend

And I know what you want from me
You want the same as me
My redemption, eternal ascension
Setting me free
So I'll take what I want, then leave

You make me wish I could disappear, no
You make me wish I could disappear

And don't you know I was trying to hold back the darkness?

And are you really okay?

Dripping crimson on the carpet

Cutting deeper than the scars could run

Whenever you appear
You leave me with that grace

But I know that you will disappear
Just as I awake
Whisper in my ear

Well, I believe
Somewhere in the past
Something was between
You and I, my dear
And it remains
With me to this day
No matter what I do
This scar will never fade

So let's make trouble in the dream world
Hijack heaven with another memory now
I make the most of the turning tide
It just split what's left of the burning silence
Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time
You turn up in the reveries of my mind
I wake up to a suicide frenzy
Loaded dreams still leave me empty

Unrevealed
Just let me go or take me with you

Do you roll with the waves?
Or do you duck into deep blue safety?
Is it always the same?
Do you wish that you loved me?
Do you pull at the chains?
Or do you push into constant aching?
Each and every day
Do you wish that you loved me?

Is there something you give
That you will never receive in return?
Do you know what it is?
Do you wish that you loved me?
And are you trying to live
Like everything is a lesson to learn?
Can you ever forgive (yourself)?
Do you wish that you loved me?

And my reflection just won't smile back at me like I know it should
And I would turn into a stranger in an instant if I could
And there is something eating me alive, I don't know what it is
Maybe not that you conceal your feelings, they just don't exist

Do you ever believe
That we can turn into different people?
It's getting harder to be (myself)
Do you wish that you loved me?
Could we ever release?
Is it better to just not feel?
Can we hit delete?
Do you wish that you loved me?

And it's been so long that I'm forgetting what it feels like
But I'd rather not remind myself and leave it all behind
And I've tried so hard to fix it all, but nothing seems to help
But I cannot hope to give you what I cannot give myself

Do you wish that you loved me? (Smile back)

For so long, I have waited
So long that I almost became
Just a stoic statue, fit for nobody
And I don't wanna get in your way
But I finally think I can say
That the vicious cycle was over
The moment you smiled at me

And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

It's that chemical cut that I can get down with
Up like the moon and out like the hounds
A dangerous disposition somehow refracted in light, reflected in sound
I'm coiled up like the venomous serpent
Tangled in your trance and I'm certain
You have got your hooks in me

I know, I know, the way that it goes
You get what you give, you reap what you sow
And I can see you in my fate
I know, I know, I am what I am
The mouth of the wolf, the eyes of the lamb
So darling, will you saturate?

And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

Nobody can say for certain
If maybe it's all just a game
When I open my eyes to the future
I can hear you say my name

So rain down on me, whoa
Rain down on me, whoa
Rain down on me, whoa (hey-yeah)
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (yeah)

Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog
But no one told you where to go

We dive through crystal waters
Perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes

My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

Well, yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and make-up
Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer, I dangle in like cold cuts
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love, but I'll take a pound of your flesh
Before you take a piece of my pay stub
White roses, black doves, Godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become

My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

I guess it goes to show, does it not?
That we've no idea what we've got
Until we lose it
And no amount of love will keep it around
If we don't choose it

And I don't know what's got its teeth in me
But I'm about to bite back in anger
No amount of self-sought fury
Will bring back the glory of innocence

My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

When we were made
It was no accident
You know my desire
We were tangled up like branches in a flood

I have travelled far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

I am thick tar on the inside burning
I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning
And a heavy head that won't stop turning
If my fate is a bad collision
And if my mind is an open highway
Give me the twilight two-way vision
Give me one last ride on a sunset skylane

Call me when you get the chance
I can feel the walls around me closing in

Just running forwards, a life like wires
As I see the past on an empty ceiling
I play along with the life signs anyway

No, by now

This bough has broken through
I must be someone new

No, for me
Just run it back, give me five whole minutes

Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry
A parallel I would lay my life on
I must be someone new
So if your wings won't find you heaven
I will bring it down like an ancient bygone

The whites of your eyes
Turn black in the lowlight
In turning divine
We tangle endlessly
Like lovers entwined
I know for the last time
You will not be mine
So give me the night, the night, the night

It's easier to try not to eat
So flood me like Atlantic, bandage up the trenches
Anything to get me to sleep

I woke up surrounded, eyes like frozen planets
Just orbiting the vacuum I am
They talk me through the damage, consequence
And how it's a pain, they know, they don't understand
Sobbing as they turn to statues at the bedside
I'm trying not to crush into sand
So flood me like Atlantic, weather me to nothing
Wash away the blood on my hands

Call me when they bury bodies underwater

Oh, and take
Take from me
Leave nothing left
Take everything

Sink, sink your teeth
Split my skin, no
Just make me bleed

Oh, and give
Give me all
All that I want
Just give me all

You know you hypnotize me always

Trapped under the surface of your words
There is a new intention
New whispers that once could not be heard
Catching your intention

Wait, talking with razors on your tongue
Just to provoke my combat
New weapons to snap those final strings
Just to watch me fall back

Do you like that? (Do you like that? No)
Do you like that?

Push down into membranes and layers
Creating a slow dissection
I stumble into your tar trap
An addition to your collection

Do you like that? (Do you like that? No)
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
Do you like that?

Fall into your eyes like a grave (all that is inside, all your anger)
Bury me into the sound of your name (all your disgust, all your resentment)
Fall into your eyes like a grave (all your differences, all your pain)
Bury me to the sound of your name (all your pain)

Oh, all your pain (bury me to the sound of your name)

You lie an inch apart on your own continuum
Now keep the freak show talk to a careful minimum
I'll find a different harbor to lay my anchor in
And you'll find a different way to keep from setting sail again, no

But I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up beneath it all
And I'm still full of the love you want
I reach for you on faith alone

Seems your heart is locked up and I still get the combination wrong
Or are you simply waiting to save your love for someone I am not?
Too many swallowed keys will make you bleed internally someday, oh, oh
Maybe you believe that in the end you will be better off that way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up beneath it all
And I'm still full of the love you want
I reach for you on faith alone

And I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up so alone
And I'll be full of the love you want
No matter what, forevermore

And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want

That hold shut the wounds of the past

So won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me?
Through a fractured existence
Won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me
From reality?
To the rhythm of eternity
Won't you fall for me?

My insecurities surround me like lions in the den
And I feel like I'm losing touch with what I am again
And slowly I remember why I cannot pretend
That I never think of you and all this screaming silence

Oh God I wish you were here

Won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me
From reality?
I am yours to the end

Every once in a while something changes
And she's changing me
It's too late for me now, I am altered
There is something beneath

She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire

Ooh, let's talk about chemistry
'Cause I'm dying to melt through
To the heart of her molecules
'Til the particles part like holy water

If anything
She's an undiscovered element
Either born in Hell or Heaven-sent
Either way I'm into it
She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white

Waiting on some holy favour
Basking in the solace of regret
And it seems my hell is your high water
Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves

When the mouth of infinity buries its teeth in me
I'll smile through the agony for you
And I know you still bear the weight of your own existence
And you'll never bear the weight of two

Waiting on some holy favour
Basking in the solace of regret
And it seems my hell is your high water
Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves

For the time being
I will admit my defeat again
I will accept that I can't pretend
We will ever be together
I can't hold myself together

To temper your belief in all my promises
To swallow my desire and choke on it

'Cause it still makes my blood run cold
To remember what they did before
The stories that you never told to me

Oh, but worry not
The blessings rain on battles in the heaven's arms
And my polite advances won't last for long
The eager apprehension is wearing off

I'd give anything
To balance your conviction with certainty
To fall asleep without you lying next to me
To sever my connection with everything

'Cause it still makes my blood run cold
To remember what I did before
The stories that you never told to me

And it still makes my blood run thin
To remember what you are to him
And I'll live like I've got missing limbs for you

Wait, won't you wait for me?
Don't you bathe in rivers?
Don't you feel alive?

And when I see you waking up
And it sends me shivers
How you love like weapons kill

So take aim
At me for once
Just take aim
Break me apart

Call, won't you call out my name
Like a curse on this world?
Like a battle cry?

Oh, and you make me hate myself
Make me tear my body
Make me yearn for your embrace

So take aim
At me for once
Just take aim
Break me apart, love

Oh, won't you?
And you know I'll be yours
When the moment is perfect
I will fire and forget 'til we both lay broken
And you know I'll be yours
Just want to be worth it
I will run like the wind 'til you follow me again

You take the dark and carve me out a home
I picture you when you are all alone
I know how we got here
I know how we got here

I am the shadow, you're a passenger
I am the intake of breath so sharp and I know you better
Just want to know you better

If you want to give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses and if
You want to give me anything then give
Give in again

I'll tear the fibre from the filament
I'll be the limit of your light again
I want to taste you better
I want to taste you better

I will be watching for your enemies
To let them know that they contend with me
I want to know you're out there
I want to know you're out there

If you want to give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses and if
You want to give me anything then give
Give in again

I just want to give
Want to give you all that I can give
All my darkest impulses and if
You want to give me anything then give
Give in again

In this open warfare
I won't fight fair
No, I won't fight fair
And in your waking moments
I will be there
I will be there

If you want to give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses and if
You want to give me anything then give
Give in again

I just want to give
Want to give you all that I can give
All my darkest impulses and if
You want to give me anything then give
Give in again

I see the gods avert their gaze from me
My fucking form is but a wreck beneath them
And there are always people I can count on
It's all so easy for me

No more taking chances
No more teeth to bite with
No more smiling faces
I am alone again

You want to talk, you want to talk it out?
'Cause the joke's on me, and I'm laughing too
You want to watch me beg, 'cause I beg so well?
It's all so easy for me

And do you like the way it feels?
Like fire from the Heavens
Carving past the surface into you
And do you like the way it feels?
Like fire from the Heavens
Tearing me asunder beside you

It's all so easy for me
It's all so easy for me

And you play a twisted little game
But I know in a way
You need to complicate

Believe that though we never eat
We still know how to feed
We still know how to bleed, oh

Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

My arms keep you in the room
Barely let you move
Show me what you do, oh

Tonight we're second-guessed again
Let me wrap the chains
Addicted to the pain, oh

Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

Do you wanna see how far it goes?
Do you wanna test me now, my love?
You must be crazy if you think that I will give in so easily
Things we buried low
Coming to the surface now, my love
You must be crazy if you think that I will give up the game

Oh, sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now

Is that a word you said, my love?
Or just a gesture in tongues?
Well, I live to guess your sorrow
And you live to empty my lungs

And you've got me up in a frenzy again
And I know you're planning to leave in the end

Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill
Entangle to one

In this light you are mine
'Til the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will?
Even if you won't

Is that a glint in your eye?
Is that a blade in your palm?
Well, I am yours tonight
So will you lay in my arms?

You've got me up in a frenzy again
I know you're planning to leave in the end

Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love

I wanna roll the numbers
I wanna feel my stars align again
Even if the earth breaks like burnt skin
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Won't you pay for your arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
So let's play
And somewhere
Somewhere, the atoms stopped fusing
I'm still your favourite regret
You're still my weapon of choosing
And out there
Stuck in a quantum pattern
Tangled with what I never said
You say it doesn't matter
I wanna be forgiven
I wanna choke up chunks of my own sins
Even if the sky cracks in mourning
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Let me pay for my arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport

I can't win
And somewhere (I made loving you a blood sport)
Somewhere, the atoms stopped fusing (I made loving you a blood sport)
I'm still your favourite regret (I made loving you a blood sport)
You're still my weapon of choosing (I can't win)
And out there (I made loving you a blood sport)
